Demo for Richard and Adam.

The project doesn't take care of aestethics. 
I could also have split the page elements in components. But that would have defeated the purpose to deliver it quickly.

The data is stored on a Parse session (mongodb) 
csvService.factory.js contains the calls to the server
utilsService.service.js wrap the calls around a promise
